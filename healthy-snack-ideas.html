        <h1>Healthy Snack Ideas for Weight Loss That Keep You Full</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Snacking gets a bad reputation in the world of weight loss-but the truth is, the right snacks can actually help you stay on track. Instead of being a diet-derailer, smart snacking keeps hunger in check, prevents overeating at meals, and supports fat loss goals. The key? Choosing snacks that are high in protein, fiber, or healthy fats so you stay satisfied for hours. Let's explore how snacking can work for you (not against you) and 10 healthy, filling snack ideas you can try today.</p>

        <h2>Why Snacks Matter for Weight Loss</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevent overeating later: Small, balanced snacks stop the "I'm starving" effect that leads to bingeing.</li>
            <li>Stabilize blood sugar: Keeps energy levels steady, avoiding crashes.</li>
            <li>Boost protein intake: Helps you reach daily targets for fat loss and muscle preservation.</li>
            <li>Curb cravings: Satisfying snacks make it easier to say no to junk food.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Makes a Healthy Snack?</h2>
        <p>Not all snacks are created equal. To support weight loss, focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Keeps you full and preserves muscle.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiber:</strong> Slows digestion, prevents hunger spikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy fats:</strong> Satisfying and nutrient-dense (but watch portions).</li>
            <li><strong>Portion control:</strong> Even healthy snacks can add up if portions are too big.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Aim for 150-250 calories per snack if you're in a calorie deficit.</p>
