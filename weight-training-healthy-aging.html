        <h1>Weight Training: A Powerful Tool for Healthy Aging</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Combats Muscle Loss & Boosts Metabolism:</strong> Research by Harvard Medical School shows strength training is vital for keeping muscles strong and boosting metabolism, which naturally slows with age. It effectively fights sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), leading to significant gains in muscle mass and strength.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Improves Balance & Reduces Fall Risk:</strong> Enhanced muscle strength directly improves balance and neuromuscular function. This significantly cuts the risk of falls, which are a major cause of injury and disability among seniors.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Supports Brain Health:</strong> Evidence shows that resistance training can preserve and even improve cognitive functions. It helps protect against brain atrophy (shrinkage) in areas of the brain associated with memory and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Promotes Independence:</strong> By preserving muscle mass, improving physical function, and supporting brain health, weight training helps seniors maintain their independence and overall quality of life.</p>
